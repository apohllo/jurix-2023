In this paper we introduced a sub-system of QAS and discussed its merits and a possible methodology for its creation. We also demonstrated via a small experiment how the methodology can be implemented and what kind of results it might return.

The work introduced in this paper is an initial work towards high-quality CESs creation. As such, there are numerous ways to optimize the process, which we consider as future work. Due to lack of space, we mention but a few of them next.

Questions are generated using LLMs fine-tuned on the same legal datasets which are used to identify examples.
